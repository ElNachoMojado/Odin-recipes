        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A recipe for a mean neapolitan flan. Mexicans can't take the credit for this but we eat it very often and it is the best thing to have after some street tacos.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can condensed milk (if you have access to La Lechera, use that).</li>
            <li>1 can evaporated milk (if you have access to Carnation, go with <strong>THAT</strong>).</li>
            <li>5 eggs.</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of vanilla essence.</li>
            <li>Half a cup of caster sugar.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add sugar to a pot and caramelize. Once it's able to flow, let it cool.</li>
            <li>Blend the rest of the ingredients and add mix to the pot with the caramel.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven at 180 degrees celsius.</li>
            <li>Set up a water bath for the flan and put it in the oven. Bake for an hour.</li>
        </ol>
